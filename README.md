android-lapse-sync
==================

A small python app to sync time lapse photos on my Android phone with Dropbox.

I received a bonsai tree for my birthday and thought it'd be cool to get some time lapse photos of as it grows.  Using SL4A, I wrote this python app to transfer the photos that the time lapse application was taking to my Dropbox account.

The OAuth client key & secret as well as the local directory is stored in a (non-committed) config.ini file in the same directory.
